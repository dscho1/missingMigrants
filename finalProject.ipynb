    "# **Missing Migrants - An Analysis on the Dangers of Seeking Asylum**\n",
    "\n",
    "Crises across the world have always been the spark of mass migrations of refugees seeking asylum. Although, despite many countries having refugee asylum programs, a widespread reluctance to accept refugees persists. Without a safe home to return to and resistant neighboring counties to refugees, many migrants take their chances in one of two options:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Apply through a country's refugee program where acceptance isn't guaranteed (and unlikely in many cases)\n",
    "2. Or, migrate illegally and risk your safety for the possibility of a new start\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the [United Nations Refugee Agency](https://www.unrefugees.org/refugee-facts/statistics/) - by the end of 2019, 79.9 million individuals were forcibly displaced worldwide as a result of persecution, conflict, violence or human rights violations. And this trend isn't decreasing (8.7 million increase from the previous year). In fact, new displacement remains very high. One person becomes displaced every 3 seconds – less than the time it takes to read this sentence. That’s 20 people who are newly displaced every minute. In 2019, there were over 30,000 new displacements each day."

Despite this challenge, the Missing Migrant Project was started in 2013 after 368 migrants died in two shipwrecks near the Italian island of Lampedusa in order to track the deaths of migrants, including refugees and asylum-seekers, who have gone missing along mixed migration routes worldwide.\n",
